# StatsCalcs
Excel calculation of various statistical measures

Can be used for general statistics computations, but was intended to aid with grading of Statistical Methods class assignments and exams. If a student gets a final answer incorrect because of a small error at an earlier step, the entire problem should not be given a zero grade, but instead it should be graded as if the incorrect early-step answer was correct and a small amount of points taken off. This is tedious and time-consuming for the instructor to trace, so they feature columns for what the original data *should be* and is overridden by incorrect data due to improper calculations, transcription or data entry, etc.

Calculations based on "Use" columns, and overridden by "Wrong?" columns, on some sheets these may be hidden for readability. Columns generally are maxed 100 scores, but calculations use entire columns so more scores can be added.

In the process of being updated/given aesthetic improvements, so some sheets are private until that happens. Full set includes ANOVA, non-parametric tests, normality tests, etc.
